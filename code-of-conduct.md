of the project

## Inclusivity and Professionalism

### You are welcome 

This mean you are to welcome to contribute and be a part of the community regardless

Contributions should focus on code, quality, and collaboration.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

Harassment, bullying, intimidation, discrimination (including ableism, homophobia (and heterophobia), sexism (of both male or female) etc.), or violent speech will not be tolerated.

Disruptive or disrespectful behavior may result in removal from the project.

## Make Software Development Great Again.
